# irc-bot-framework

## Synopsis

The goal of this project is to make it simple and easy for you to create your own node.js IRC robot based on
plugins that are simple to write. I will provide a number of plugins that I find useful, as I'm sure others
will. The goal, though, is that you can easily spin up an IRC bot and write a plugin for it in only a few
minutes.

In other words, if you have a task that you want done via IRC command, you will be able to focus on the actual
task at hand rather than the protocol itself.
